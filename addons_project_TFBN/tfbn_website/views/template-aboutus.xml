                          <p class="text-muted">A contributory, autonomous and sustainable community, made of business people led by common values and interests. This network supports French business culture in Ontario through opportunities, events and joint projects in the long term.</p>

                          <h3 class="mt8 mb0">Values</h3>
                          <p class="text-muted">Being originally a French network, it is important that its members adhere firstly to French values. Of course, the republican and democratic ideals, Liberty, Equality and Fraternity must be the first to come to mind. But we urge you to also share the “joie de vivre”, humor and good mood, tolerance and respect for others. </p>
                          <p class="text-muted"> </p>
                          <p class="text-muted">As a business network, it is also important that members show solidarity, generosity and mutual assistance, and act with honesty and integrity. Accessible to all, the network can only exist on the basis of exchanges in the acceptance that to receive, we must also know how to give. </p>
                          <p class="text-muted"> </p>
                          <p class="text-muted">Finally, we urge everyone to keep an open mind and demonstrate curiosity.</p>
